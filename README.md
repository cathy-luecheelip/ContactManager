# ContactManager
Simple contacts manager. 

1. .NET Coding Challenge
2. Coded using .NET Core
3. Only allows one phone number per contact. Still need to add a one-to-many contact to phone.
4. Still need to add logic to only display contacts with home phone and sort by contact's last name.
5. Still need to work with the display to make it user-friendly.
6. I tried to connect to LiteDB, but I had issues. Instead, I used the .NET Core "Create the initial database schema using EF's migration feature" described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/model?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio
7. To run the app (Ctrl+F5) and append /Contacts to the URL in the browser (http://localhost:port/contacts).
